# Jekyll it is

Welcome.

After now nearly 1.5 years (first commit 831068be3c48c40e9dcbe4665e1a49c93789bf0f) of slow progress I finally transfered my old website from Drupal to Jekyll as good as can be expected.

## Drupal to Jekyll

- had a lot of views (one for each content type + all posts)
  - autopages for the win
- recreating content-types with category
- recreating taxonomies with tags
- Transfering content from HTML to MD to be parsed to HTML again
- Rebuilding meaningful last-updated since to revisions
- features missing: search

## i18n

I tried to translate every post on my old site but it was hard to keep the content at the same state.
Having a WYSIWYG editor to fight with felt like having your hands tied so I ended up doing most of my writing in source-code view of the editor.
It was hard to transfer paragraphs and even simple formatting from one to another language.

With this now gone and having markdown at my disposition for creating content I think this will ease my workflow and allow me to post more often and even translate everything.

It could also happen that I write some posts only in English.
This will probably make it nearly undiscoverable for a normal visitor but we will see.
