# Kepler International

## General

This is my site.
My precious.
It is built with [Drupal][drupal], for me the number one CMS for a scalable Website.

[drupal]: http://isthissitebuiltwithdrupal.com/https://kepler.international

## Purpose

This site is mostly for shenanigans.
This is my test area for drupal and web develoment and possibly a place for feedback from you.
For me it is easier to show my results here because nowadays almost everyone has access to the internet and a browser.

## Content

Besides its experimental charakter this side will serve as information site.
You will find all my projects and their results here.
If it is convenient I will write matching Tutorials and How-Tos.
As soon as I would like I start to write Reviews to some topics.
The Blog will have a special state.
Depending on my mood I will publish entries to topics I find intertesting.

## Tutorials

I will do my very best on testing and explaining all the tutorials.
Although I can't ensure that there aren't any little mistakes.
So use them on your own risk.
I suggest using them as guideline or reference.
I don't think that I will write about crittical things that could cause severe damage but I don't know.
If you notice a mistake and have some time please notify me about it.
I try to correct it as fast as possible.
