# X-Ray for music

I have watched a few movies on Amazon Prime in the last couple of day and have used from time to time the very good X-Ray functionality.
I got a problem that I often see actors in movies and series and get them confused with other actors.

While using it I noticed an extended mode where further movies and series are listed one could know the person.
So I found some interesting suprises there.

In addition to the actors, pieces of music that can be heard in the current scene are also displayed.
I finally found out that a certain piece was from Beethoven's 7th Symphony in A major.
(It was Op. 92 II, the Allegretto).
I had heard this piece in another film some time ago and unfortunately could not find any information about it.
Thanks to X-Ray, I now have a title and composer, but unfortunately I can't remember in which other film I also stumbled across the song.

## X-Ray for music

I had an idea by chance that it would be cool to have a database for music that links it to various other artistic works.
A kind of extended X-Ray for music.
So one could have the chance to lookup in which movie, series or video game the song has appeared.
It would certainly be interesting to see what soundtrack music was used for other things.
I know for a fact that certain songs from the Need for Speed soundtrack have been used in Mass Effect or vis verca.
Especially songs like Fortunate Son by Credence Clearwater Revival as far as I know was used in many video games and probably in the same amount of movies and series.

## Display

You could search on a website for a song and have each linked artistic work shown.
It would additionally be interesting if similar versions could be shown.
Especially in electronic music it is not uncommon to have ten remixes, eight bootlegs, six refixes, five versions and what ever you think of.
So it would come in handy to know that version x of a song is known from this film as well.

## Implementation

Concept or not.
The implementation would be very extensive and difficult.

- How deep do you try to cover something?
- Which version should be listet?

I could nevertheless imagine that it could bring a certain added value.
You could build an extenstion for Amazon's existing X-Ray

## Final thoughts

If there happens to be such a project or a similiar one I would be happy to get a pointer to it.
If I should be there first to think of something like that and write it down I would like to see my name mentioned in an implementation of such project.
