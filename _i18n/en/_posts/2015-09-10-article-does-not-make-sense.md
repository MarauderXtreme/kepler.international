# This article does not make sense

Well.
I promised to translate everything.
So I will do it but I have to inform you that this article is mainly for my german audience.

It is about one special german phrase that translate into "smthg makes sense".

## Difference between English and German

In German to make something means that something gets produced.
Since sense can not be produced but rather is the result of a logic equation.
So in German something results in sense and does not make sense.
I know it is quite confusing for non german speaker.

## So what?

The Duden what is the german rule set for good spelling allows both versions.
But why is that a problem? Well the Duden allows something obviously wrong.
It is like the german version of their, there and they're.
These things should be obvious for a native speaker but seem to be a tough task.

I mutated in some kind of grammar nazi correcting people who mispelled it.
I just realised that this is not okay.
But it bothers me a lot but only since a couple of months.
It was brought to my attention by Matze and Nelson.
So blame them.

I decided to stop doing so.
I will not correct anyone anymore.
I think it bothers me more than them.
So if I expose my pain about this wrong phrase they tend to use it even more.

## Does this affect me?

Since it is only a german thing only if you speak German.
Otherwise this is just some trivia about my mother tongue.
That's enough for the translation
