# Useful Drupal Modules

We use Drupal as CMS for our website projects at work.
The Drupal world lives from its modularity.
By now nearly nothing exists that has a web frontend you cannot realise with Drupal.
You can create everything with specialised modules from a simple blog over e-commerce up to erp solutions.
As of writing this there are 32945 modules on [drupal.org][drupal].
Some of them are probably outdated or only available for version 6 and prior.
It is nevertheless difficult to keep track of all the important modules.

In this tutorial I will only cover modules that are useful for every installation if Drupal.
I will not introduce modules for field-definitions and no content modules.
It should be about modules that make working with Drupal easier and better.
Some of those modules fit in the category "modules I always wanted but never knew".

Some modules depend on each other.
Some modules are in this list because they are a dependency for many other modules but are themselves seldomly used.
I will update and extend this list from time to time.
Maybe this list becomes a profile that I can use for Drupal installations.

Please let me know should you know a module that should not be missing on this list.
Just write me via one of the channels that are linked in the footer.
