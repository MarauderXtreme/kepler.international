# Email with own and new top-level-domain

Half a year ago I finaly got a fitting email provider for my domain.
Its not easy to find a reasonably priced provider for a custom domains.
After I found out that my registrant only offers their 1GB shared I canceled this offer quickly.
That was not viable since I wanted to provide for my family at the same time.
As I continued my search the name [Fastmail][fastmail] popped up some time.
Their offer and their work looked good to me and after talking with [Kilian][kilian] I gave it a try.
I have to say that Fastmail really leaves nothing to be desired.

## Infinite aliases

After I send my first mail and configured a lot I had to migrate my accounts.
Due to the possibility of infinite aliases and to sort them directly I went a bit wild and started to separate thematically.
It is wonderful to run your accounts over multiple email addresses but still have everything in one account.

## Inadequacy of some internet services

I have to admit that international as top level domain is not common.
I understand people asking me: "and?", when I say [kepler.international][kepler] as web address.
With internet services its a different thing.
Those are more than often frameworks that run the evaluation of the domain.
Those should be kept up-to-date by their developers.
At least that have been requested from me at my work.

Services like Facebook, Steam, Twitter but also smaller ones like BundleStars accept email addresses that end on kepler.international.
I thought this was not uncommon until it came to Ubisoft.
Since I own a UPlay account I wanted to reconfigure it.
Just as an aside Steam as well as Origin accepted the address.
The change alone is a somewhat cumbersome affair but the security aspect behind it makes sense.
As I reached the point where I could enter my email address I was met with an error that claimed it was a valid address.
Well, I could already guess what the problem was but I wanted to stay without bias and contacted their support.
After all I only had to write to the support at Mindfactory to get the change without a problem after that.

It was suggested to me from Ubisoft Support to use another address.
Sure, I got infinite aliases.
As I tried some other I still got the same result.
So it was back to support time.
Now I got told that the domain is the problem.
I have to admit that i was disappointed since UPlay did not seem like the small online service that operated by the motto "never change a running system".
So I wrote an answer with suggents for improvement, where to find valid tlds and that I would want a notification if this situation changes and I just got a kind of template default answer.
They regret it and can understand my frustration. (>implying)
If I can think of another email I should contact them again.
Because you can just make up functional email addresses.
Not!
Welcome to new territory.

## Help is near

After I had problems on two other places and got similar answers from their support I had to get a new generic domain.
Luckily I found *.one.
Luckily not taken and available for a rather reasonable price.
Did I mention that it is quite difficult to find a domain if you got a "famous" name.
But more to this later.

After I configured this domain on Fastmail I had to try changing it again.
Lo and behold, a miracle happened and my email was accepted.
Excuses and lies that are told by customer support.

On one oth the other two sites I got the response that they had never seen international as a tld and I should check if that it no mistake.
After I had written them that I run a website there for some time now and have recieved and sent mail the response got even wilder.
The tld is way to new to be accepted by their system and that would not change in the near future.
I set [kepler.one][kepler-one] as address a few weeks later.

### Factcheck

General availability (according to [domains.info][domain-info]):

- *.international 09.04.2014
- *.one 20.05.2015

I do not need to understand that, right?
Gotcha!
You just have a dump regex running over the input.
At least be honest and do not blame it on the age.

## Everything moved?

By now every big services is moved to the new domains.
I am now occasionally going through my old 500 mail strong account and migrating the mails.
It's a hell of a job, as there are some spam mails in between where I was too lazy to delete them.
I probably dedicate a few day of my next holidays to cleaning up.
