# Videogame radio playlists

At the beginning of this year I got myself a Spotify account because I found out that there are playlists for ingame soundtracks of videogames.
I got from time to time the urge to listen to the original soundtrack (OST) of various games I played.
Especially for the examination phase at uni I noticed that music from videogames could help my concentration and I could learn better.
With Spotify I did not need to listen to playlists on Youtube or create my own lists in WinAmp.

At this point I want to give recognition to especially EA because they provide playlists for the OSTs but also the normal songs included.
This is really nice for entries from the Need for Speed series.
For most parts I got on Spotify because of them.

After creating a huge Need for Speed playlist that included everything from Underground to Carbon and additionally Undercover I thought of searching for lists of ingame radiostations.
Unfortunately my search did not bring up good results.
So I started to recreate as well as possible my favourite radio stations from video games.

In this [Github repo][repo] you can find everything I build.
Not all of the lists are complete since there are some songs missing on Spotify.
They are marked in the tables.
If you find things that are currently not included or maybe fit better than the current entries let me know.

## Update

[Felix][felix] offered to recreate the playlists on Apple Music so this project could become more independet from the provider.
