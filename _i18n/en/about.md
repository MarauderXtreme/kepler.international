# BOfH

My name is CHristoph Kepler.

I am in charge of this site.
It serves me as a container for my sporadic thoughts, storage for things I reuse from time to time and explanations of said things if someone finds them useful too.
I can improve my writing and language skills while tending to the site.
Find more about it in the [project description][project].

What am I doing if I'm not tinkering on the website or creating new content for you?

- DevOp engineer
- IT
- web developer
- gamer
- tech enthusiast
- linux freak
- book lover (well, I got a Kindle now too)
- IT support for friends and family
- active member of AG DSN

My school career starts in 2000 in the elementary school in Sch√∂nau-Berzdorf.

From 2004 to 2012 I went to the grammar school in Herrnhut.
Also experienced a change of sponsorhsip there.
I can tell you that this was quite something.

From 2013 to 2019 I studied CompSci at the TU Dresden and from 2012 to 2015 I trained as an IT specialist for application development.
I worked for [ARTS Deutschland GmbH][arts] in the IT department from 2012 to August 2016.
This is the first time I cam in contact with Drupal.
I gathered my 'whole' experience while working on [aircareer.de][aircareer] and maintaining [First Aid][first-aid].
In this time I created some in-house modules in Drupal.
Nothing special but I am proud of it.

From September 2016 to September 2019 I worked at [manaTec Gmbh][manatec].
The IT department of the ARTS had spun off and is now an independent company.
I mostly continued work on the websites of ARTS and their sister and subsidiary companies.
But timer after time more of those websites were moved to different systems but I got the new project [myonso][myonso] as relaunch for mobile devices which I tended to until the end of my tenure.

In October 2019 I changed to [Tyclipso GmbH][tyclipso] or rather their predecessor and I work their since.
I have the position of DevOp engineer and look after processes to get code to servers and make them more structured and faster.
Alongside this I maintain server environments and take care of other IT related topics.

## Why BOfH as profilename of all things?

Well.
A former instructor of mine pointed those stories out to me.
So I have read some of them and I have to say there are some really great pieces among them.
Unfortunately they are heavily dated and also no longer well known but I would recommend them to every IT staff member.

## What is BOfH?

BOfH stands for **B**astard **O**perator **f**rom **H**ell.
Those are a series of stories of an IT operator (yes, a very old term) and his daily struggles.
They are written by New Zealand author Simon Travaglia.
He himself is the main character of his at least party fictional stories.
It started as a series of small tales in newsgroups but has been collected and put out as books.
This German [article][stup] from the mock wikipedia Stupidedia explains pretty well what those stories are about.

[The site of the bastard][bofh] and his more current [articles][register].
