### Relevant legal basis

Below you will find an overview of the legal basis of the GDPR on the basis of which we process personal data.
Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile.
If, in addition, more specific legal bases are relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection declaration.

- **Contract performance and pre-contractual enquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b. DSGVO)** - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or for the performance of pre-contractual measures taken at the data subject's request.
- **Registered interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. DSGVO)** - Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data.

In addition to the data protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation, national regulations on data protection apply in Germany.
These include, in particular, the Act on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG).
In particular, the BDSG contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, the processing for other purposes and the transmission and automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling.
Furthermore, it regulates data processing for purposes of the employment relationship (Section 26 BDSG), in particular with regard to the establishment, implementation or termination of employment relationships as well as the consent of employees.
Furthermore, data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.

## Security measures

We take appropriate technical and organisational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.

The measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access to, input of, disclosure of, assurance of availability of and segregation of the data.
We also have procedures in place to ensure the exercise of data subjects' rights, the deletion of data and responses to data compromise.
Furthermore, we already take the protection of personal data into account in the development or selection of hardware, software and procedures in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.
