      A stylised telescoped build out of four rectangles.
      It points into the upper right corner.
      The lowest rectangle being upright, dark in colour and stick-shaped defines the stand.
      There is a small dark in colour rectangle pointing in the lower left corner acting as the eye piece.
      In the middle there is a bright in colour (orange) longer rectangle that symbolises the body.
      At the end in the upper right there is a dark in colour larger rectangle embodying the lens.
      Above all stands the site name 'Kepler International'.
