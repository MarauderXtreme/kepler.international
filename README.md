# Kepler International

This is my personal website where I keep my blog, an overview of my projects, some tutorials and some reviews.

Basically everything I find, encounter or do in one place to learn about.

## i18n

I will try to translate every post either from de to en or vice versa.
That beeing said there is currently a lost of posts untranslated due to circumstances on my old website that made it relatively hard to transfer content with decorations etc. from one to another language.

## Built With

This site is built with pure will and magic powers.
Some of those magic tools are:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
  - Have a look at the [Gemfile](Gemfile) what plugins are installed
  - Have a look at the [_config.yml](_config.yml) what plugins are activated and how they are configures
- [Foundation for Sites](https://get.foundation/sites.html)
  - The heavy-loading for responsiveness is done via Foundation with minor tweaks from me.
- [simpleicons](https://simpleicons.org/)
  - I have a list of my social medias in the footer of the website.
    Each icon there is from simpleicons.
- [shields.io](https://shields.io/)
  - I use this for the project quick info and this itself uses simpleicons
- Beautiful fonts
  - [FiraGO](https://github.com/bBoxType/FiraGO)
  - [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)
  - [Unifraktur Maguntia](http://unifraktur.sourceforge.net/de/maguntia.html)

This is as good as a rebuilt of my old Drupal website.
Obviously some of the dynamic features and other things requiring a backend with a database are missing.
